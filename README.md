# Drive Google Street View Car

Necessary file is map.js

To view the demo, just open index.html in your browser and enter the required fields.

You can also checkout the demoe at http://spicavigo.github.com/streetview-video/

The video will fail to load if the Google API Key I am using hits the Quota. In that case, come back the next day or open the JS console of your browser and run gdrive.setKey("YOUR OWN STREET VIEW IMAGE API KEY").
